I am a software developer at Dolcera Information Pvt Ltd.I have built a strong foundation in both development and data analytics. I spent 5 months working as a Data Analyst, refining my skills in data-driven decision-making. I then shifted focus to working with Generative AI tools, particularly transformers with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and developed applications using Flask and Celery for seamless task execution. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in designing and deploying scalable architectures on AWS, ensuring robust and efficient solutions.
